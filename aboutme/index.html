        <h2>Dustin Rush</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am joining class this semester from North Idaho in a city called Hayden, where I have lived for just over 5 years. Prior to that I lived in Wenatchee (2017), Spokane (2005 - 2017) and Moses Lake (1992- 2005), which are all in central and eastern Washington State.</p>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Applied Technology. Since 2008, I hve worked in various IT positions, including IT help desk, desktop administration, server and network administration, and most recently as a IT supervisor. I have a personal goal of obtaining this degree mainly to prove to myself that I can do this even in my advanced age :) and to be a good example to my kids of the value of post-secondary eductaion.</p> 
        <p>My wife and I met way back in 1997 when we were in high school. Both of us were band nerds. I played
         the trumpet and she played the flute, bassoon and tenor saxophone. I was not a member of the church, nonetheless many of my
         friends, including her, were church members. After high school we did not really keep in contact much.  I ended up joining the church in my freshman year of my first college attempt (in the year 2000).  About a year later I had decided to serve as a  full-time missionary and left to the MTC and Portugal to fufill that calling. After completing a mission, I ended up in Spokane for several years before we were able to re-connect.  In 2017 we were married in the Columbia River Temple and I moved to Wenatchee where she had been living and working as a labor and delivery nurse at the local hosptial. Later that year, we decided to leave Wenatchee and move to Northern Idaho in the Coeur d'Alene area (Hayden is about 5 miles north of Coeur d'Alene).</p>
        <p>In 2018 we began hosting foster care kiddos in our home.  In 2020, we began pursuing the adoption of a sister and brother that we welcomed into our home in April of that year.  In December 2020 we adopted them and have since been sealed together in the temple. They are 9 and 6 years old currently.</p> 
        <p>Currently, I am serving as the Elder's Quorum President in my ward and work full time as an IT supervisor for a local Electric Cooperative serving power to about 32,000 members in North Idaho.</p>
